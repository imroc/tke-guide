# Connecting to Game Server with Client

## Download Game Launcher

You can download the game launcher for your system from the official Microsoft Minecraft website, but you must purchase the official version. If testing or only playing on your own game server, you can use [HMCL](https://github.com/HMCL-dev/HMCL/blob/main/README_cn.md), an open-source launcher that can be downloaded from the [release page](https://github.com/HMCL-dev/HMCL/releases). Below demonstrates using HMCL's offline account.

## Download the Game

After downloading the launcher, double-click the jar package (ensure a high-version Java environment is installed locally), then download the latest Minecraft version on the **Download** page (click into the version and click the install button in the lower right corner):
